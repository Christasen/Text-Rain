## Abstract
Text Rain is an engaging video-based digital installations that has been exhibited dozens of times around of world, created by by Romy Achituv and Camille Utterback. In this project, I re-implemented this interactive art installation with the support of my professor Daniel Keefe. I wrote my Processing sketch to create a similar interactive experience, mimicking the interface of Text Rain.
